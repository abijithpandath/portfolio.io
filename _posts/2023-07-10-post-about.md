# ASPIRING DATA PROFESSIONAL 
Curiosity has always been my compass—and data, my favorite language to explore the world.<br>
With a Master's in Data Science from Coventry University (UK, 2024) and a Bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering (2020), my journey has been rooted in STEM, driven by a deep analytical mindset and a desire to solve real-world problems through data.
<br>
Professionally, I began at Tech Mahindra as a Technical Support Associate, where I learned the value of precision, responsiveness, and customer-focused troubleshooting. I then joined Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) as an Assistant System Engineer, contributing to scalable IT solutions while enhancing my skills in collaboration, adaptability, and structured problem-solving.
<br>
Throughout this journey, I’ve built a strong foundation in tools like SQL, Excel, Python, Tableau, Word, and PowerPoint. My portfolio includes hands-on projects in:
<br>
- Data Cleaning & Transformation using Excel and SQL
- Data Analysis via SQL, ETL processes, and dashboards
- Visualization & KPI Design in Tableau
<br>
At Coventry, I engaged in rigorous coursework in Python, SQL, R, and Tableau, while also pursuing industry-recognized certifications:
<br>
- Chartered Management Institute – Level 7 Certificate in Strategic Management & Leadership
- Cisco Networking Academy – Data Analytics Essentials
- AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials
- Forage Simulations – British Airways (Data Science) & JP Morgan (Agile)
<br>
I bring with me a suite of transferable skills: critical thinking, attention to detail, leadership, time management, research, and a collaborative approach.
Currently, I’m diving deeper into AI and ML, driven by a mindset to learn, apply, and grow—transforming raw data into meaningful impact.
