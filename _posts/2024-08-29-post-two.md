1. ## üè† Real Estate Price Prediction Web Application [Git-Hub](https://github.com/abijithpandath/Projects/tree/main/Real%20Estate%20Price%20Prediction%20Web%20Application)

I developed a web application to predict real estate prices in Bangalore, aimed at helping buyers, sellers, and investors make informed decisions. The project involved building a reliable predictive model using Linear Regression, creating a scalable backend with Python Flask, and designing a user-friendly web interface with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows users to input property details and receive price predictions in real-time. It effectively integrates machine learning with a responsive front end, demonstrating my skills in data science, machine learning, and model deployment.

2. ## üìâ Customer Churn Analysis  [Git-hub](https://github.com/abijithpandath/Projects/tree/main/Machine%20Learning%20Approaches%20to%20Customer%20Churn%20Prediction)

I developed a predictive model to identify customers at risk of churning, addressing a key challenge in customer retention for the company. By analyzing and preprocessing data, training various machine learning models, and evaluating their performance, the model effectively pinpointed at-risk customers. This allowed the company to implement targeted retention strategies, reducing churn rates and enhancing customer satisfaction. The project utilized Python, Jupyter Notebook, and various machine learning libraries to deliver actionable insights and support better business decisions.

4. ## üö¶ Road Traffic Accidents Analysis Using Machine Learning Algorithms  [Git-Hub](https://github.com/abijithpandath/Projects/tree/main/Road%20Traffic%20Accident)

I developed a predictive model to analyze and forecast road traffic accidents, aiming to improve traffic management and accident prevention. The project involved data preprocessing, handling duplicates and missing values, and training multiple machine learning models such as Random Forest and SVM. Using Python libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the model achieved 90% accuracy, identified high-risk zones, and pinpointed peak hours for accidents. This provided actionable insights to help manage traffic and prevent accidents more effectively.
