# Data Visualization Using Tableau

1. ## ‚úàÔ∏è British Airways Review Analysis Dashboard - [Git Hub](https://github.com/abijithpandath/Projects/tree/main/Tableau%20Dash%20Board%20For%20British%20Airways%20Review%20Analysis)

I developed an interactive Tableau dashboard to analyze customer reviews for British Airways, helping stakeholders easily assess feedback on various service aspects like cabin staff, entertainment, and seat comfort. The dashboard, built using cleaned data from Kaggle, features interactive elements such as line charts, maps, and bar charts, allowing users to explore trends, geographical distribution, and performance across aircraft types. This tool has enabled British Airways to gain actionable insights, track customer satisfaction over time, and make data-driven decisions to enhance service quality and customer experience.
