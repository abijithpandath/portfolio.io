# 🎓📚✏️ Course Works & University Projects

1. ## 🐞 Beetle Game Using Python Fundamentals - [Git Hub](https://github.com/abijithpandath/Projects/tree/main/Beetle%20Game)

Developed an interactive Beetle Game to showcase my foundational knowledge of Python programming. The game uses Python’s control structures to manage game logic, simulating dice rolls with the `randint` function and controlling game flow with loops and conditionals. The text-based user interface allows players to interact and collect beetle parts. This project effectively demonstrates the practical application of Python fundamentals through an engaging and completed game.

4. ## 🚦 Road Traffic Accidents Analysis - [Git Hub](https://github.com/abijithpandath/Projects/tree/main/Road%20Traffic%20Accident)

Developed a predictive model to analyze and forecast road traffic accidents, aiming to improve traffic management and accident prevention. The project involved data preprocessing, handling duplicates and missing values, and training multiple machine learning models such as Random Forest and SVM. Using Python libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the model achieved 90% accuracy, identified high-risk zones, and pinpointed peak hours for accidents. This provided actionable insights to help manage traffic and prevent accidents more effectively.
