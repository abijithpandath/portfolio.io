  <br> I specialize in transforming raw data into actionable insights that drive strategic decision-making. With a comprehensive skill set in Python, R, SQL, Tableau, and Power BI, alongside expertise in statistical modeling, I am adept at uncovering patterns and trends that contribute to business success.
