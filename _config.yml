  Having graduated with a Masterâ€™s degree in Data Science from Coventry University, I specialize in leveraging data analytics and machine learning to derive actionable business insights. I am looking for data-focused roles in the technology and consulting industries. I have the right to work in UK.
  <br> Achieved hands-on experience in cutting-edge technologies like Machine Learning, Big Data Analytics and Data Visualization through various academic assessments, projects and virtual internships from JP Morgan Chase&Co and British Airways. My journey has equipped me with demonstrable skills in Python, R, SQL, and Tableau, enabling me to analyze data effectively and derive actionable insights.
